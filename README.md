# Dataset: Spatial Interaction Analysis of Infectious Disease Import and Export between Regions

## Overview
This repository contains materials for the study: [Spatial Interaction Analysis of Infectious Disease Import and Export between Regions](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/21/5/643). The analysis focuses on understanding the spatial dynamics of infectious disease transmission between regions, specifically within the context of COVID-19. The dataset is divided into three main sections:

1. **Time-varying Modeling with Spatial Interaction:**
   - This section includes the model fitting results for each month across 50 states. These results illustrate the temporal changes in disease transmission patterns.

2. **Transmission Import Index:**
   - This part contains the changes in the transmission import index over time.
   - A map plot visualizing the transmission import index.
   - A summary of COVID-19 related events that may have influenced transmission patterns.
